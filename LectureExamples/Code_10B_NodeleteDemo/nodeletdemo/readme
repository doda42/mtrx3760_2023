A simple publisher and subscriber implemented as nodelets.
Inspired by the nodelet demo code by cryborg21 https://github.com/cryborg21/sample_nodelet
and the nodelet code at https://www.clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/ros/Nodelet%20Everything.html


run using roslaunch:
roslaunch nodeletdemo nodeletdemo.launch

or by manually instantiating a nodelet manager and the two nodelets:
rosrun nodelet nodelet manager __name:=my_nodelet_manager
rosrun nodelet nodelet load nodeletdemo/nlistener my_nodelet_manager
rosrun nodelet nodelet load nodeletdemo/ntalker my_nodelet_manager
